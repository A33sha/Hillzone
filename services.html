          <p> Hillzone seeks investments across asset classes and around the world through a process of bottom-up
            fundamental research and analysis emphasizing capital preservation. Our core industries are dynamic and driven
            by rapid innovation. Each of the industries we focus on is dynamic and driven by rapid innovation, and over

            <h4>Invesments and Corporate Banking</h4>
            <p>Our Investment & Corporate Banking team has a wealth of experience in providing
              strategic advisory
              services and a track record of successful deal execution. We bring expertise in multiple sectors with
              deep
              understanding and commitment to the businesses we serve. We provide expert advice to secure financing
              for
              large, complex transactions.
              With  Hillzone Group, clients can expect tailored solutions for all of their finance and
              investment
              service needs.

            <h4>Direct Investments</h4>
            <p>Our Direct Investments are typically longer-dated, less liquid private market
              transactions and may be in
              various parts of the capital structure. We generally look for inefficiently financed situations where
              we
              can facilitate a recapitalization, or situations in which traditional institutional financial capital
              is
              not available. This strategy can include transitional financing in the form of senior secured and
              mezzanine loans, project and non-performing loan portfolios, convertible debt, event and growth
              equity.
