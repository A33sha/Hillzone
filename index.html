            <p>Our Investment & Corporate Banking team has a wealth of experience in providing
              strategic advisory
              services and a track record of successful deal execution. We bring expertise in multiple sectors with

            <h4>Direct Investments</h4>
            <p>Our Direct Investments are typically longer-dated, less liquid private market
              transactions and may be in
              various parts of the capital structure. We generally look for inefficiently financed situations where
              we
              can facilitate a recapitalization, or situations in which traditional institutional financial capital
              is
              not available. This strategy can include transitional financing in the form of senior secured and
              mezzanine loans, project and non-performing loan portfolios, convertible debt, event and growth
              equity.
